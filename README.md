##1. Cross-Platform Tourism App

#### Developed using Ionic Framework, AngularJS and Firebase
Firebase is the database that has been used in this project. Firebase is a real-time cloud data service and provides an API that stores and syncs data across multiple clients/ devices and it serves millions of users in no time. Firebase database is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs, all of the clients share one Firebase database and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

##2. Admin Panel - Web Application
The web application is developed using AngularJS, HTML 5 and CSS. The web app is hosted live on Hosting24.com and can be accessed [here](http://www.technologywolves.com/). The main purpose of the web app is to allow administrators interact with the database (Firebase). All CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations to the database are performed using this web application and all the changes made to the database using the web app are updated on mobile apps in real-time.
